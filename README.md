# find-deleted-expiring-domains
This is a PHP tool which finds recently deleted or expiring domain names that match a certain criteria.
You can set it up as a cron job on your server to check for deleted or expiring domain names.

The tool goes through a list of words from a dictionary and adds TLDs (Top Level Domains) to these words. It then
searches the WHOIS repository to check for domain expiry date. If it is expiring in less than N days (can be set in config file)
or if it has recently been deleted, the domain is listed in the output (or log file). 

You can setup a number of parameters in the config file like max number of characters in domain name (4-8), domain expiring in 
number of days, domains deleted in number of days, frequency of checking TLDs, etc.
You can add a dictionary of words by supplying a plain text file "words.txt" in the root directory of the application. 
You can also specify a list of TLDs you would like checked by adding them to "tlds.txt".

**Installation Instructions**
1. Create database using the supplied "whois_one.sql.zip" file by importing it directly to your database
2. Unzip the "whois-complete.zip" to your server.
3. Edit the "config.php" file in the root folder and change the following parameters:
	
  $approot = "https://emulate.ml/whois"; // URL to the directory....not required
  $dbhost  = 'localhost';    // Unlikely to require changing
  $dbname  = 'whois_one';    // DATABASE NAME
  $dbuser  = 'username';     // DATABASE USER
  $dbpass  = 'password';     // DATABASE PASSWORD 

4. Edit the "config" text file in the root folder and change the following:
  # email message
    send_mail_to_name = John doe
    send_mail_to = someone@gmail.com
    mail_subject = Expiring / Deleted domains email report
    mail_body = Report for today is found in the attached text file. <br> Thanks.

    mailer_secure = tls
    mailer_port = 587
    mailer_from = somebody@gmail.com

5. Delete the "log.txt" file in the root folder and make root folder writable by apache
